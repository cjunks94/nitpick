## Detail

### #87 cjunks94/resume-improvements
- MISS `particle-scene.js:65` [useful/defensive] isLightBg parses hex and rgb()/rgba() but not hsl()/hsla(); browsers may serialize --c-bg as hsl() so light-theme detection silently breaks

### #29 cjunks94/agentic-portfolio
- MISS `src/agentic_portfolio/web/api.py:589` [useful/security] _make_broker docstring documents demo_mode fail-safe contract but doesn't enforce it; future LiveBroker addition could bypass demo gate without a regression check

### #56 cjunks94/panoptrain
- MISS `packages/client/src/lib/tafCurrentPeriod.ts:28` [useful/correctness] selection loop picks last in iteration order, not latest timeFrom — assumes upstream returns basePeriods sorted ascending

### #121 cjunks94/exportee-rails
- HIT `app/services/sources/salesforce_adapter.rb:44` [useful/correctness] extract accumulates all records into rows[] before returning, so it holds the entire result set in memory. For large Salesforce result sets (Restforce auto-paginates via Restforce::Collection), this can exhaust memory; consider using lazy enumeration or streaming to the caller.
- EXTRA `app/services/sources/salesforce_adapter.rb:26` [useful/performance / N+1] introspect_schema calls client.describe(sobject["name"]) for every queryable object inside a map, producing N+1 round-trips to Salesforce. For orgs with hundreds of objects this will be slow and may hit API limits; there is no batching or concurrency.
- EXTRA `app/services/sources/salesforce_adapter.rb:74` [useful/correctness] credentials falls back to the entire config hash when the "credentials" key is absent (`connection.connection_config.fetch("credentials", config)`), meaning top-level config keys (instance_url, sandbox, api_version) would be treated as credentials and real credential keys would be missing, silently passing nil values to Restforce.

### #101 cjunks94/exportee-rails
- MISS `app/controllers/api/v1/base_controller.rb:83` [useful/security] bad_request_with_message renders raw exception.message from ArgumentError; risks leaking internal context (CLAUDE.md: error messages must not leak internal details)

### #59 cjunks94/panoptrain
- MISS `packages/client/src/lib/scheduleIdle.ts:18` [useful/correctness] setTimeout fallback hardcodes 1ms and ignores the timeoutMs parameter; docstring promises 'soon-ish' upper bound but fallback fires next tick regardless of caller intent

### #117 cjunks94/exportee-rails
- MISS `app/services/transforms/data_frame_pipeline.rb:100` [useful/security] const_get with widget_name from YAML config can resolve to unintended constants; safer to dispatch via an explicit widget→class hash
- EXTRA `app/services/transforms/data_frame_pipeline.rb:101` [critical/] NameError raised for unknown widget names: `Widgets::Builtins.const_get(widget_name.camelize)` will throw NameError if the constant doesn't exist, crashing the export rather than falling back gracefully. This path is hit for both `mask_email` and any unknown widget, so a misconfigured or third-party widget name silently breaks the entire run. A rescue NameError returning `df` (or logging and skipping) is needed.

### #57 cjunks94/resume-improvements
- EXTRA `.github/workflows/canary-build.yml:23` [useful/nonexistent-action-version] actions/checkout@v6 does not exist; the latest major release is v4. This will cause all workflow runs to fail at the checkout step.
