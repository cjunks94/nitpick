## Detail

### #87 cjunks94/resume-improvements
- MISS `particle-scene.js:65` [useful/defensive] isLightBg parses hex and rgb()/rgba() but not hsl()/hsla(); browsers may serialize --c-bg as hsl() so light-theme detection silently breaks

### #29 cjunks94/agentic-portfolio
- MISS `src/agentic_portfolio/web/api.py:589` [useful/security] _make_broker docstring documents demo_mode fail-safe contract but doesn't enforce it; future LiveBroker addition could bypass demo gate without a regression check

### #25 cjunks94/agentic-portfolio
- MISS `src/agentic_portfolio/web/runs.py:82` [critical/correctness] try_start refuses on status=="running" with no staleness/lease check; pre-PR mark_started overwrote unconditionally, so a process death mid-run (redeploy SIGTERM kills the daemon thread before mark_failed) now wedges both POST /api/run (409) and the weekly cron (skipped) permanently on the persistent volume

### #56 cjunks94/panoptrain
- MISS `packages/client/src/lib/tafCurrentPeriod.ts:28` [useful/correctness] selection loop picks last in iteration order, not latest timeFrom — assumes upstream returns basePeriods sorted ascending
- MISS `packages/server/src/services/taf-poller.ts:95` [critical/correctness] deriveCeiling matches raw-TAF token "VV" but the JSON feed encodes obscured sky as cover "OVX" with base null and the height in the sibling vertVis field; fixture has 3 such groups; ceilingFt is null in the LIFR fog case
- MISS `packages/server/src/services/taf-poller.ts:74` [useful/correctness] Number("") is 0 and passes isFinite, so upstream's empty-string visib (present on 5 overlay groups in the fixture) parses to 0 sm instead of the documented null; needs an explicit blank check before the numeric fallthrough

### #121 cjunks94/exportee-rails
- HIT `app/services/sources/salesforce_adapter.rb:45` [useful/performance] The `extract` method accumulates all Salesforce records into memory via `rows << normalize_record(record)` before returning. For large objects Restforce's `query` returns a lazy-paginated enumerator, so this defeats pagination and can OOM on large result sets. Consider using `client.query_all` with streaming or yielding records rather than collecting them all.
- MISS `app/services/sources/salesforce_adapter.rb:66` [critical/correctness] explicit api_version: nil overrides Restforce's default in its options merge (concerns/base.rb merge!), so a connection that omits the documented-optional key hits /services/data/v/... and 404s on every call; specs stub Restforce.new so they can't see it
- MISS `app/services/sources/salesforce_adapter.rb:27` [useful/perf] introspect_schema describes every queryable sobject in a sequential loop: hundreds of HTTP calls per introspection on a stock org, eating the daily API allocation; batch via composite describe or describe lazily
- EXTRA `app/services/sources/salesforce_adapter.rb:74` [useful/correctness] The `credentials` fallback `connection.connection_config.fetch('credentials', config)` silently falls back to the entire top-level config hash (which contains `instance_url`, `sandbox`, etc.) if the `credentials` key is absent. Any caller that omits `credentials` will pass the wrong values (e.g., `client_id` from config) to Restforce, and the error will be non-obvious. The fallback should be an empty hash or raise explicitly.

### #101 cjunks94/exportee-rails
- MISS `app/controllers/api/v1/base_controller.rb:83` [useful/security] bad_request_with_message renders raw exception.message from ArgumentError; risks leaking internal context (CLAUDE.md: error messages must not leak internal details)
- MISS `app/controllers/api/v1/base_controller.rb:13` [useful/correctness] rescuing ArgumentError globally converts programmer errors (wrong arity, Integer('x'), Pagy overflow) into client-facing 400s and hides real bugs from error tracking; rescue the specific enum-assignment case instead

### #59 cjunks94/panoptrain
- MISS `packages/client/src/lib/scheduleIdle.ts:18` [useful/correctness] setTimeout fallback hardcodes 1ms and ignores the timeoutMs parameter; docstring promises 'soon-ish' upper bound but fallback fires next tick regardless of caller intent
- MISS `packages/client/src/App.tsx:113` [useful/performance] no in-flight dedup between the idle preload and useRouteShapes; switching modes while the preload is downloading triggers a second parallel multi-MB fetch and the preload result is discarded

### #54 cjunks94/panoptrain
- MISS `packages/client/src/lib/trackInterpolation.ts:95` [critical/correctness] bestShapeCache.clear() sits after the WeakMap early return, so returning a memoized index leaves the other mode's ShapeData refs in bestShapeCache; with the documented subway/LIRR routeId overlap a re-entered mode's trains snap onto the other mode's geometry (fixed upstream in panoptrain #158)
- MISS `packages/client/src/hooks/useTrainFeatures.ts:94` [critical/correctness] mode-reset deliberately leaves shapeIndexRef alone, but the routes-build effect early-returns on null routeShapes, so on a cache-miss flip (or a failed routes fetch) train polls for the new mode are pathed against the previous mode's index; subway/LIRR routeIds collide so trains land on the wrong geometry (fixed upstream in panoptrain #59)

### #117 cjunks94/exportee-rails
- MISS `app/services/transforms/data_frame_pipeline.rb:100` [useful/security] const_get with widget_name from YAML config can resolve to unintended constants; safer to dispatch via an explicit widget→class hash
- MISS `app/services/exports/executor.rb:25` [useful/correctness] Polars branch times widget transforms inside the write_ms block while legacy counts them in transform_ms, so the metrics the README advertises for A/B comparison are apples-to-oranges
- MISS `app/services/transforms/data_frame_pipeline.rb:27` [critical/correctness] DataFrame.new(rows) infers dtypes from the first 100 rows (polars-df N_INFER_DEFAULT); a column that is nil or a different type in those rows and populated later raises a ComputeError and fails the run, order-dependent; pass infer_schema_length: nil or an explicit schema
- EXTRA `app/services/transforms/data_frame_pipeline.rb:101` [critical/] If `widget_name` is not a known constant under `Widgets::Builtins`, `const_get` raises `NameError` (not a handled rescue), which will bubble up as an unhandled exception instead of the intended graceful fallback. An unknown widget name from user/config data can crash the export run.
- EXTRA `app/services/transforms/data_frame_pipeline.rb:25` [useful/] When `rows` is empty, `legacy_write` is called but `mapping_fields` may not be column-ordered against an empty dataset, and crucially the returned hash from `legacy_write` is passed directly as the result — but the caller in executor.rb checks `result[:bytes_written]` against `max_upload_bytes`. If `Destinations::Writers::Csv.write` returns a different shape (or nil), the size check at line 92 will raise `NoMethodError` or silently skip the guard.
